# ECE204-PROJECT 4

This project explores Nonparametric statistics for evaluating censored reliability functions. 

The aim of this project is to construct genome-wide survival models based on gene expression and somatic mutation data to identify likely prognostic clinical biomarkers in cancer patients. The 
appropriate clinical endpoint need to be selected taking into consideration any censoring of the data. 

The required files to run are Project4.ipynb for analysis on mutations and gene_expression_analysis.ipynb for analysis on gene expression values. We have explored survival analysis, log rank tests and cox-regresiion models with FDR correction analysis in these files for the datasets which are obtained from TCGA.

For analysis on HPV run the hpv.ipynb.
