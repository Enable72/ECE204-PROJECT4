# ECE204-PROJECT4

This project explores Nonparametric statistics for evaluating censored reliability functions. 
The aim of this project is to construct genome-wide survival models based on gene expression and somatic mutation data to identify likely prognostic clinical biomarkers in cancer patients. The 
appropriate clinical endpoint need to be selected taking into consideration any censoring of the data. 
The required files to run are Project4.ipynb and gene_expression_analysis.ipynb.
